Challenges in This Project
There are two types of Challenges in this Project. Each one is designed to prepare you for a scenario that you're likely to encounter as a web developer.

Description
An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

## Challenge Types
The two types of Challenges are the following:

1.On-the-job ticket or feature request Challenges give you starter code in a folder called Develop, which needs to modify.

2.Job-seeking coding assessments or take-home assignments

## Challenge Elements
1.Challenges adhere to a format that's commonly used by software development teams that use agile project management to manage  work. Practicing this will prepare for the workflows you'll experience as a professional full-stack web developer.

2.Deep Dive: To learn more about agile.

## Each Challenge contains the following elements:

1.User Story: This is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who is requesting the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. This follows an AS AN / I WANT / SO THAT format. For example, "AS A shopper visiting an online store, I WANT to place items in a shopping cart, SO THAT I can purchase them."

2.Acceptance Criteria: These are the requirements that you must meet to satisfy the scope of work. They are not exhaustive, but they do entail the minimum aspects of a working solution. Consider this a checklist of baseline requirements. Acceptance criteria can be presented in various ways. In this case, we'll use a common format called scenario-oriented criteria which expresses each requirement in a WHEN / THEN format.

3.Mock-up: This is an image or animation that demonstrates the design and functionality of the web application that you'll build for the Challenge.

4.Submission:  completed Challenge for review. In the real world, when a developer finishes working on a project, another developer reviews the code, providing feedback on errors and making sure that all of the acceptance criteria have been met. For each Challenge, your instructional staff will serve as your team of reviewers.

## Refactoring
Refactoring existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology is a common task for front-end and junior developers. For this particular Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.
